## Notes to graders

For the sake of reproducibility, the directory "Data" should contain the original
"raw" data set as downloaded from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.
It is not required for graders to run the code, but, if you wish to do so
1) clone this github repository to your computer
2) Download the "raw" data set from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository
3) Unzip the downloaded file in the Data directory (replace the dummy file in there)
4) Set the current R directory to the directory that contains the cloned plot*.R files

Note how the code to load the data assumes that the file located inside the "Data" directory.

All plots are generated with explicit width=480 and height=480, even though these
are the defaults for the PNG device in my system.
